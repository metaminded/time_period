h1. time_period gem

h2. Mission Objective

Store time periods as "3 days" or "7 weeks" in a database.

We use one simple varchar column in which we store the value as above in the format "<integer> <day|week|month|year>".

h2. Example

In the migration, define a string field:

<pre>
  ...
  t.string :duration_period
  ...
</pre>

In the model, declare the field as 'being a time period':

<pre>
  class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    time_period :duration_period, default => 7.days
    ...
  end
</pre>

then, you get the following methods:

* <tt>duration_period</tt> – raw reader of the saved string.
* <tt>duration_period_unit=</tt> – setter for the unit, i.e., "day", "week", ...
* <tt>duration_period_number=</tt> – setter for the number, i.e., 1, 2, 3
* <tt>duration_period=</tt> – setter for the complete period, accepts either strings as above or <tt>ActiveSupport::Duration</tt> objects as <tt>3.weeks</tt>
* <tt>duration_period_value</tt> – reads the value as an <tt>ActiveSupport::Duration</tt> object

<pre>
  >> m = MyModel.new
  >> m.duration_period_unit = "day"
  "day"
  >> m.duration
  => "0 day"
  >> m.duration_period_number = 7
  => 7
  >> m.duration
  => "7 day"
  >> m.duration_period_value
  => 7 days
  >> m.duration = '3 week'
  => "3 week"
  >> m.duration_period_value
  => 21 days
</pre>

For <tt>simple_form</tt> forms, we offer an input:

<pre>
  <%= simple_form_for @my_thing do |f| %>
    ...
    <%= f.input :duration_period_value,  as: :time_period %>
    ...
  <% end %>
</pre>

The result then looks a little bit like this:

h2. Disclaimer

This is pretty much work-in-progress-without-reasonable-documentation. So if you use it, don't complain ;)

Nevertheless, bug reports and improvements are highly appreciated:

h2. Contributing to time_period

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the <a href="https://github.com/metaminded/time_period/issues">issue tracker</a> to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
* Feel free to send a pull request if you think others (me, for example) would like to have your change incorporated into future versions of time_period.
